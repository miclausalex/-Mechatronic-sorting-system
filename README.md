# -Mechatronic-sorting-system

The project consists of a mechatronic system for object sorting, which could serve as the foundation for an industrial application.
To achieve this, we utilized a conveyor and a Python program with OpenCV.
The sorting belt was entirely constructed by our team, utilizing available and accessible components.
The focus was placed on the sorting system, which employs a camera, an Arduino board, and two servo motors for driving the sorting paddles.
Additionally, our objective was to identify a cost-effective and applicable solution for object sorting in the industry, capable of handling
objects with varying characteristics. The system can be scaled up for industrial use and effectively sorts objects of various shapes and sizes,
at appreciable conveyor speeds.
